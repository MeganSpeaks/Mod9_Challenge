# Surfs Up Challenge
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop is a sustainable business year-round.  To do this, I analyzed temperature data from June and December.
## Results
1. June Temperatures (in Fahrenheit)
- mean = 74.944118
- minimum = 64
- maximum = 85
- first quartile = 73
- median = 75
- third quartile = 77
3. December Temperatures (in Fahrenheit)
- mean = 71.041529
- minimum = 56
- maximum = 83
- first quartile = 69
- median = 71
- third quartile = 74
## Summary
The temperatures for June and December indicate that business can be sustained year-round.  In addition to the above queries, I gathered the precipitation data for June and December.  The averages for precipitation are less than 1 inch for June and December both.  This is good news for business as well.
